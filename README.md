# House Value Prediction using Deep Learning

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Description
This project utilizes deep learning techniques to predict house values based on various features such as location, size, amenities, and market trends. The goal is to develop an accurate and robust model that can assist in estimating property values for real estate purposes.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/triobaba/house-value-prediction.git

2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r [Requirements](requirements.txt)





## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset by following the instructions in the [Dataset](#dataset) section.

2. Configure the model parameters and hyperparameters in the appropriate files.

3. Train the deep learning model using the [Training](#training) section instructions.

4. Evaluate the model's performance using the [Evaluation](#evaluation) section guidelines.

5. Use the trained model to predict house values by providing new input data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of historical house sale records, including various features such as location, size, number of rooms, etc. It is stored in a CSV file format. Before using the dataset, ensure that it is preprocessed and cleaned appropriately to remove any missing values or outliers.

## Model Architecture
The deep learning model architecture employed for house value prediction consists of several layers, including input, hidden, and output layers. The specific architecture details, such as the number of layers, activation functions, and optimizer, are defined in the code files.

## Training
To train the deep learning model:
1. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. Set the appropriate hyperparameters, such as learning rate and batch size.
3. Run the training script, which will iteratively update the model's weights and biases to minimize the prediction error.

## Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the trained model:
1. Calculate relevant evaluation metrics, such as mean absolute error (MAE) or root mean square error (RMSE).
2. Compare the predicted house values with the actual values from the testing set.
3. Use visualization techniques, such as scatter plots or residual plots, to analyze the model's predictions and identify any patterns or outliers.
